## The project

Hike Log is to be a fun app to record your hikes
Users will be able to upload pictures and set a hike starting point
they will be geolocalized and able to follow their progress on a map
then upload at least another image to end hike
which will measure distance, steps and elevation and add it to your stats.
Users then can compare their scores with global leaderboard

## Rules and levels

start with no pins;
1st hike gets you a snowflake
3rd hike your 1st star
5th hike 2nd star
10th hike 3rd star
30 hikes chamoix
once you have 3 stars, your fastest hike - relative to distance is your fleche
